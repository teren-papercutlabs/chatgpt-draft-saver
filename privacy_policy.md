# Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Draft Saver

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the ChatGPT Draft Saver Chrome extension ("Extension", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Extension.

## Information Collection and Use
The ChatGPT Draft Saver Extension is designed with your privacy in mind. Here's how we handle your data:

### What We Collect
- **Draft Messages**: The Extension temporarily saves the text you type in ChatGPT conversations.
- **Conversation IDs**: We store a unique identifier for each ChatGPT conversation to associate drafts with the correct conversations.
- **Timestamps**: We record when drafts are saved to manage them properly.

## How We Store Your Data
- All data is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
- **No data is transmitted** to our servers or any third-party servers.
- Your data remains **on your device** and is not accessible to us or any other parties.

## Data Retention
- Draft messages are **automatically deleted** when you send a message in ChatGPT.
- If you **uninstall** the Extension, all stored drafts are **permanently deleted**.

## Third-Party Services
- The Extension **does not** integrate with or utilize any third-party services, analytics tools, or tracking mechanisms.

## Your Rights
Since all data is stored **locally on your device**, and we do not collect or process any of your data on our servers, **you maintain complete control** over your information.  
You can **clear all stored data** by uninstalling the Extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.  
We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the **Chrome Web Store listing** for the Extension.
